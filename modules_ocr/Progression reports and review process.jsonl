In the first instance it may flag situations in which supportive steps can be\ntaken to address this. In more complex situations it may help evaluate if the PhD is right for all involved before\ninvestment of more time and money.

{"text": "Following progression from first year, normally in June each year you are also expected to present your work in a\ndepartment-wide forum at the Departmental Postgraduate Symposium Gala.

Your review team\nwill usually aim to meet with you (if you have a poster) or else attend your talk and discuss informally after as\npart of the review process. This is expected to be a poster presentation in your second year and an oral\npresentation in your final year. For students with longer supervised study periods, there may be some flexibility\nto present a poster or oral presentation in any additional years. It is understood some cohort model PhDs (e.g.\nCDTs) or research themes may offer additional opportunities to present, but it is anticipated most students will\nbe excited to share their work at this event. In exceptional circumstances where the outcome of sharing your\nresearch has been met in other ways and separate arrangements with the review team to hold a discussion can\nbe reached, alternative arrangements can be made by consultation with the Director of Postgraduate Studies.", "module": "Progression reports and review process", "source": "https://durhamuniversity.sharepoint.com/teams/ChemistryPostgraduates/SitePages/Progression-Reports.aspx", "page": 7}
